It allows users to add changes to the staging area, which are then ready to be committed. In Git terminology, this is similar to adding files to the index. The function computes the hash of the file contents, stores them in an object database (typically as \"blobs\"), and updates the index to track the files.</p> <p>Purpose of add The main goal of the add function is to:</p> <p>Stage changes made to files by adding them to the version control system's index (staging area). Compute a unique hash for the file content. Store the file content as a \"blob\" object in the object database, allowing for efficient tracking of file content changes. Update the index file to reflect the changes made to the staging area. How It Works File Input: The add function takes the path to a file as input. The user specifies which files to add to the staging area (for example, using a command like git add ). <p>Reading the File Content: The content of the specified file is read into memory. This can be done using standard Go file I/O operations (e.g., ioutil.ReadFile).</p> <p>Hashing the File: The content of the file is hashed using a hashing function (typically SHA-1 or SHA-256) to create a unique identifier for the file. This hash is what will be used to store the file in the object database.</p> <p>Creating the Blob Object: Once the file content is hashed, a \"blob\" object is created. This blob object contains the file's content and its unique hash.</p> <p>Storing the Blob Object: The blob object is stored in an object database (a directory in your project, typically located under .git/objects), where each object is stored as a file with the hash value as its filename.</p> <p>Updating the Index: The index (or staging area) is updated to reflect the added file. This is usually done by creating or modifying an index file that tracks which files have been staged. The index stores the file path and its corresponding object hash.</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func add(filePath string) error {     // Implementation here } Parameters filePath (string): The path to the file that needs to be staged. This is the file the user wants to add to the staging area. Returns error: Returns an error if the operation fails (e.g., if the file cannot be read, or if there is an issue with hashing the content). Otherwise, it returns nil to indicate that the file has been successfully staged. Steps in the Implementation Check if the File Exists: The function first checks whether the file exists at the given path. If not, it returns an error indicating that the file could not be found.</p> <p>Read the File: If the file exists, the function reads its content into a byte slice. This is done using Go\u2019s standard file reading libraries.</p> <p>Compute the Hash: After reading the file content, the function computes the SHA-1 hash of the file's content. This hash uniquely identifies the file content.</p> <p>Create and Store the Blob: Once the hash is computed, a blob object is created and stored in the object database. The file content is stored as a new object file with the hash as its filename.</p> <p>Update the Index: Finally, the function updates the index file to include the new file and its corresponding object hash. This allows Git to track the staged file for future commits.</p>"},{"location":"cat_file/","title":"Cat File","text":"<p>cat_file Function The cat_file function is responsible for displaying the contents of a Git object, given its hash. In a Git-like version control system, files and other data are stored as objects in the object database, identified by their hashes. The cat_file function allows users to retrieve and view the content of these objects. This is similar to the git cat-file command in Git, which shows the content of a specific object.</p> <p>Purpose of cat_file The main goal of the cat_file function is to:</p> <p>Retrieve and display the content of an object (such as a blob, tree, or commit) from the object database. Provide a way to view the raw content of a Git object using its hash. This function is useful for inspecting stored objects and for debugging purposes when working with a Git-like version control system.</p> <p>How It Works Object Hash: The cat_file function takes the hash of a Git object (e.g., a commit, tree, or blob) as input. The user provides the hash of the object they want to view.</p> <p>Retrieve Object: The function looks for the object in the object database (typically a .git/objects directory or equivalent).</p> <p>Object Type Detection: The function retrieves the object, and based on its type (whether it\u2019s a blob, tree, or commit), it interprets the content appropriately.</p> <p>Display Object Content: Once the object is retrieved, the function decodes its content and displays it to the user. The content could be raw file data (in the case of blobs), directory structure (in the case of trees), or commit information (in the case of commits).</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func catFile(hash string) error {     // Implementation here } Parameters hash (string): The hash of the object whose content needs to be retrieved and displayed. Returns error: Returns an error if the object cannot be found, if there is an issue reading the object, or if the object type cannot be interpreted. If the operation succeeds, it returns nil. Steps in the Implementation Check if the Object Exists: The function first checks if an object with the specified hash exists in the object database. If the object does not exist, an error is returned.</p> <p>Read the Object Content: If the object is found, the function reads its content from the object database. This could involve reading from a file system or a database.</p> <p>Identify the Object Type: The object is then inspected to determine its type. Git objects can be blobs (file content), trees (directory structure), or commits (snapshot of the repository). The type can often be determined by reading the object\u2019s header or analyzing its structure.</p> <p>Display the Object\u2019s Content:</p> <p>If it\u2019s a blob, the raw file content is displayed. If it\u2019s a tree, the directory structure is displayed, showing the files and subdirectories. If it\u2019s a commit, the commit metadata (such as author, timestamp, commit message, and parent commit) is displayed. Handle Errors: If any issues are encountered while reading or interpreting the object, the function returns an appropriate error message.</p>"},{"location":"checkout/","title":"Checkout","text":"<p>checkout Function The checkout function is responsible for switching between different branches or commit histories in a Git-like version control system. It allows users to move to a different commit or branch, updating their working directory with the content of that commit or branch. The checkout function also handles switching between branches and restoring files from previous commits.</p> <p>Purpose of checkout The main goal of the checkout function is to:</p> <p>Switch between commits, branches, or tags in the repository. Update the working directory to reflect the state of a particular commit, branch, or tag. Restore files to the state they were in at a previous commit or branch. Handle scenarios like creating a new branch or restoring a file from a previous state. How It Works Commit or Branch Selection: The checkout function takes a commit hash or branch name as input. The user provides the commit or branch to which they want to switch.</p> <p>Branch Handling: If a branch name is provided, the function determines the commit hash of that branch and performs the checkout by moving to that commit. If the commit hash is given directly, the function will check out that commit.</p> <p>Update Working Directory: After determining the commit to check out, the function updates the working directory by replacing the current files with those from the checked-out commit. This includes adding, removing, or modifying files as necessary.</p> <p>File Restoration: If the checkout is for a specific file, only that file will be updated to its state in the specified commit or branch.</p> <p>New Branch Creation: If the user wants to create a new branch from the current state, the function can handle this by creating a new branch reference pointing to the current commit.</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func checkout(identifier string, createNewBranch bool) error {     // Implementation here } Parameters identifier (string): The commit hash or branch name to check out. This specifies which commit or branch the user wants to switch to. createNewBranch (bool): A flag indicating whether the user wants to create a new branch from the current commit. If true, a new branch will be created at the current commit\u2019s location. Returns error: Returns an error if the checkout operation fails. This could happen if the specified commit or branch doesn\u2019t exist or if there is an issue updating the working directory. If the operation is successful, it returns nil. Steps in the Implementation Resolve the Identifier: The function first checks whether the provided identifier is a branch name or a commit hash. If it's a branch name, the function resolves it to the corresponding commit hash. If it's a commit hash, it is used directly.</p> <p>Check if the Commit Exists: The function checks whether the commit or branch exists. If not, it returns an error.</p> <p>Update the Working Directory: Once the commit or branch is resolved, the function updates the working directory by checking out the files from that commit. This involves:</p> <p>Removing files that no longer exist in the new commit. Adding files that are present in the commit but not in the working directory. Modifying files to reflect their state in the commit. Create a New Branch (if applicable): If the user has requested a new branch, the function creates the branch by adding a new reference to the branch pointing to the checked-out commit.</p> <p>Handle Errors: If any errors occur during the checkout process, such as missing files or an invalid commit, the function returns an appropriate error message.</p>"},{"location":"commit/","title":"Commit","text":"<p>commit Function The commit function is responsible for creating a new commit in the repository. A commit represents a snapshot of the repository\u2019s current state, including all files in the working directory that have been staged for commit. This function creates a commit object, stores it in the object database, and updates the current branch\u2019s reference to point to the new commit.</p> <p>Purpose of commit The main goal of the commit function is to:</p> <p>Capture the current state of the working directory by creating a commit. Store changes in the repository\u2019s history, making it possible to refer back to the state of the project at a specific point in time. Update the current branch to point to the newly created commit, thereby advancing the branch history. How It Works Staging Area: Before committing, files must be staged. This typically involves adding modified or new files to an index or staging area, marking them for inclusion in the commit.</p> <p>Commit Metadata: When committing, the function collects metadata such as the author (user), commit message, timestamp, and the parent commit (the previous commit on the branch).</p> <p>Create Commit Object: The commit function creates a new commit object, which includes the following:</p> <p>The hash of the tree object (representing the current file state). The hash of the parent commit. The commit message. The author\u2019s information. Store Commit Object: The function generates a hash for the commit and stores it in the object database.</p> <p>Update Branch Reference: After the commit is created, the current branch\u2019s reference (a pointer to the commit) is updated to point to the new commit, effectively advancing the branch history.</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func commit(message, author string) error {     // Implementation here } Parameters message (string): The commit message describing the changes made in this commit. author (string): The name and email of the author, typically formatted as \"Name \". Returns error: Returns an error if the commit operation fails. This could happen if there are no changes to commit, if the staging area is empty, or if there is an issue with writing the commit object. If the operation is successful, it returns nil. Steps in the Implementation Check if There Are Staged Changes: The function checks whether there are any files staged for commit. If there are no staged files, it returns an error indicating that there\u2019s nothing to commit. <p>Create Tree Object: A tree object is created to represent the current state of the files in the staging area. The tree object contains a list of all files and directories, along with their corresponding object hashes.</p> <p>Generate Commit Object: A commit object is created that includes:</p> <p>The hash of the tree object created in the previous step. The hash of the current branch\u2019s parent commit. The commit message and author information. Store the Commit Object: The commit object is stored in the object database, and its hash is calculated.</p> <p>Update the Branch Reference: The current branch\u2019s reference is updated to point to the newly created commit, advancing the branch\u2019s history.</p>"},{"location":"hash_object/","title":"Hash Object","text":"<p>hash_object Function The hash_object function is responsible for calculating the hash of a given object (such as a file or a directory) in the Git-like version control system. The hash is used to uniquely identify objects in the object database, ensuring that objects can be retrieved and referenced consistently throughout the system.</p> <p>Purpose of hash_object The main goal of the hash_object function is to:</p> <p>Compute a SHA-1 hash of the content of an object (file or directory). Store the object\u2019s content in the object database. Ensure that the same content results in the same hash, enabling version control and integrity checking. How It Works Object Types: The function is designed to handle different types of objects, including:</p> <p>Blob Objects: Represent the content of a file. Tree Objects: Represent directories and the files within them. Commit Objects: Represent commit information, including parent commit references, tree object hashes, and commit metadata. Input Content: The function accepts content, either from a file or a directory, and prepares it for hashing. For files, this involves reading the file content. For directories, the function creates a representation of the directory\u2019s structure.</p> <p>Object Formatting: Before calculating the hash, the content is formatted according to Git\u2019s object model. This includes adding a header with the object type and size, followed by the raw object content.</p> <p>SHA-1 Hashing: The formatted object content is passed through the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to generate a 40-character hash.</p> <p>Storing the Object: The object (if new) is stored in the object database, using its hash as the filename.</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func hashObject(objectType string, content []byte) (string, error) Parameters objectType (string): The type of the object being hashed. Common types include \"blob\" for file content, \"tree\" for directories, and \"commit\" for commit data. content ([]byte): The raw content of the object to be hashed. This could be the contents of a file, directory, or commit information. Returns string: The 40-character SHA-1 hash of the object. error: Returns an error if the object type is invalid or if there is an issue with the hashing process. Steps in the Implementation Validate Object Type: The function checks if the provided objectType is valid (either \"blob\", \"tree\", or \"commit\").</p> <p>Prepare the Content:</p> <p>For a blob, the content is simply the raw file content. For a tree, the content includes the file names and their corresponding object hashes. For a commit, the content includes the commit message, author, timestamp, parent commit, and the tree object hash. Format the Content: The content is prefixed with the object type and size in bytes, following Git\u2019s object format. For example, a blob object would be formatted as \"blob \\0\". <p>Compute the SHA-1 Hash: The formatted content is passed through the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to generate the object hash.</p> <p>Store the Object (if new): If the object is new, it is written to the object database. The file is named using the computed SHA-1 hash.</p>"},{"location":"init/","title":"Init","text":"<p>init Function The init function is responsible for initializing a new Git-like repository. It sets up the necessary directory structure, configuration files, and initializes the object database that will store all the objects (such as commits, trees, and blobs) for the repository. This is the first step in creating a new repository.</p> <p>Purpose of init The main goal of the init function is to:</p> <p>Create the basic directory structure for the repository. Initialize the object database where Git stores all objects (blobs, trees, commits). Set up initial configuration files that allow the system to track the repository state and configuration settings. Provide the foundation for further Git operations such as commits, branches, and object hashing. How It Works Create Repository Structure: The function creates the basic directory structure required for a Git repository:</p> <p>.git/: The main directory for all Git data. .git/objects/: Where all objects (blobs, trees, commits) will be stored. .git/refs/: Stores references to branches and tags. .git/HEAD: Points to the current branch reference (e.g., refs/heads/main). .git/config: A configuration file for the repository. Initialize Object Database: The object database is the heart of the version control system, where all the objects are stored. The init function ensures that the .git/objects/ directory is created.</p> <p>Create Configuration Files: The function creates the .git/config file, which contains default configuration settings for the repository. This file typically includes settings such as the repository name, remotes, and user information.</p> <p>Create Initial Branch: An initial branch (usually main or master) is created in the .git/refs/heads/ directory. This branch will point to the first commit made in the repository.</p> <p>Create HEAD File: The HEAD file is created to point to the default branch (e.g., refs/heads/main), which will be the active branch for the repository.</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func initRepo() error Parameters The initRepo function does not take any parameters. It works on the current directory and initializes the repository in the current working directory.</p> <p>Returns error: Returns an error if the initialization process fails. This could happen if the directory structure cannot be created, or if there are issues with file permissions. If the operation is successful, it returns nil. Steps in the Implementation Check if Already Initialized: The function first checks if the .git directory already exists in the current working directory. If it does, an error is returned indicating that the repository has already been initialized.</p> <p>Create the .git Directory: If the .git directory does not exist, it creates the necessary subdirectories:</p> <p>.git/objects/ .git/refs/heads/ .git/config .git/HEAD Set Up Default Branch: The function creates the initial branch (main or master), which will serve as the first branch in the repository. It creates a reference file under .git/refs/heads/ pointing to this branch.</p> <p>Write the HEAD File: The HEAD file is created to point to the default branch (e.g., refs/heads/main). This file indicates the current branch the repository is on.</p> <p>Create Default Configuration File: The function creates the .git/config file, which can later be updated with user-specific settings (e.g., user name and email).</p>"},{"location":"log/","title":"Log","text":"<p>log Command The log command displays the commit history of the current branch in a Git-like version control system. It provides information about past commits, such as the commit hash, author, date, and commit message, helping users track changes made in the repository over time.</p> <p>Purpose of log The main goal of the log function is to:</p> <p>Display a list of commits for the current branch. Provide details about each commit, including the commit hash, author, date, and commit message. Help users review the history of changes in the repository. How It Works Read the HEAD File: The log function first reads the HEAD file to determine the current branch. This file contains a reference to the current branch, such as refs/heads/main.</p> <p>Read the Current Branch Reference: Once the current branch is determined, the function looks in the .git/refs/heads/ directory to find the latest commit for the branch. This file contains the hash of the latest commit in that branch.</p> <p>Traverse Commit History: The function starts from the latest commit and follows the parent commit references to traverse the commit history. Each commit points to its parent commit(s), and the function retrieves information about each commit.</p> <p>Display Commit Information: For each commit, the function displays the following details:</p> <p>Commit Hash: The unique identifier of the commit. Author: The name and email of the author. Date: The timestamp when the commit was created. Commit Message: The message provided by the user when creating the commit. Stop at the Root Commit: The process continues until a commit with no parent is found (the root commit), at which point the function stops.</p> <p>Function Signature go Copy code func log() error Parameters The log function does not take any parameters. It works by reading the commit history of the current branch as indicated by the HEAD and refs/heads/ files. <p>Returns error: Returns an error if there are issues accessing the repository or reading commit data. If the operation is successful, it returns nil. Steps in the Implementation Read the HEAD File: The function first reads the .git/HEAD file to determine which branch is currently checked out.</p> <p>Read the Current Branch Reference: Using the branch reference, it reads the corresponding commit hash from the .git/refs/heads/ directory.</p> <p>Read the Commit Object: The function retrieves the commit object from the object database using the commit hash.</p> <p>Traverse the Commit History: For each commit, the function retrieves the parent commit hash and displays the commit details (hash, author, date, and message).

It allows users to see the structure of the repository at a particular point in time, displaying the tree of files, directories, and their respective object types (blob or tree).</p> <p>Purpose of ls_tree The main goal of the ls_tree function is to:</p> <p>Display the contents of a specific commit or tree object. Provide a structured view of files and directories in a commit. Help users navigate and inspect the content at a particular point in the repository's history. How It Works Read the Tree Object: Each commit in a Git repository points to a tree object, which represents the file structure at that point in time. The ls_tree function reads the tree object from the object database using the commit hash or tree hash provided.</p> <p>Parse the Tree Object: A tree object contains entries that point to other tree objects (subdirectories) or blob objects (files).

It provides an overview of the repository's status, helping users manage their changes before committing them.</p> <p>Purpose of status The primary goal of the status command is to:</p> <p>Provide users with a summary of the changes in their working directory. Inform users about the files that are staged for the next commit, as well as the ones that are modified but not staged. Show untracked files that are not yet part of the repository. How It Works Working Directory Check: The function checks the working directory for any changes that have been made to files since the last commit. These can include modifications to existing files, new untracked files, or deletions.</p> <p>Staging Area Check: The function checks the staging area to see which files are ready to be committed. This includes files that have been added to the staging area using the add command.</p> <p>Untracked Files: Any new files in the working directory that are not tracked by the version control system will be listed as untracked.</p> <p>Modified and Staged Files: Files that have been modified and added to the staging area are shown as staged for the next commit.</p> <p>Display Information: The status function displays the following:</p> <p>Modified files not yet staged for commit. Files that are staged and ready for commit. Untracked files. Function Signature go Copy code func status() error Parameters This function does not take any parameters, as it simply checks the state of the repository and working directory. Returns error: Returns an error if there is an issue accessing the repository's status (e.g., if the .git/ directory is missing). If successful, it returns nil. Steps in the Implementation Check the Working Directory: The function checks for any modified files in the working directory. It compares the current state of the files to the last commit's tree object to determine if changes have been made.</p> <p>Check the Staging Area: It retrieves the files that have been staged for the next commit from the index file (the staging area). These files are ready to be committed.</p> <p>List Untracked Files: The function checks for any files in the working directory that are not yet being tracked by the version control system. These files are not part of any commit and are considered untracked.</p> <p>Display the Status: The function outputs a summary of the repository's status, categorized into:</p> <p>Changes not staged for commit: Files that have been modified but are not yet added to the staging area. Changes to be committed: Files that are staged and ready to be committed. Untracked files: Files that are not tracked by the version control system.</p>"},{"location":"objects/blobs/","title":"Blobs","text":"<p>Blobs In a version control system like Git, a blob (binary large object) is used to store the contents of files. Unlike regular files, blobs in a version control system are stored in a compressed format with no metadata (such as filenames or timestamps) associated with them. The blob\u2019s primary purpose is to represent the file's content at a specific point in time.</p> <p>In this Git-like version control system, blobs are used to store the actual content of files, which can then be tracked across commits and versions. The blob's contents are immutable, meaning once a file\u2019s content is stored in a blob, it cannot be changed. Any modification to the file will result in the creation of a new blob.</p> <p>What is a Blob? A blob is a data object that represents the contents of a file. The main characteristics of a blob are:</p> <p>Content: The blob stores the raw content of a file, such as text, images, or binary data. Hash: Each blob is associated with a unique hash, typically generated using a hash function (like SHA-1 or SHA-256). This hash serves as the identifier for the blob and allows the version control system to efficiently track changes to the file's contents. No Metadata: Unlike files on a file system, blobs do not store any metadata (e.g., filenames, timestamps, permissions). Their only role is to hold the file content. Blob Structure in the Repository Blobs are stored in the repository\u2019s object database. In Git-like systems, this is usually located in the .git/objects/ directory. The object ID for each blob is the hash of the file's content.</p> <p>Blob Object: The object is created by hashing the contents of the file, then storing this hash in the object database. Filename Mapping: The blob does not store the filename. Instead, the filename is mapped to the blob object through other structures like trees (which represent directories). How Blobs Work Creating a Blob: When a file is added to the version control system, the contents of the file are hashed, and the resulting hash is used to create a new blob object. This blob object is stored in the object database.</p> <p>Modifying a Blob: If the content of the file changes, the version control system will create a new blob with the new content and a new hash. The old blob remains in the object database, but the new blob is tracked for the new version of the file.</p> <p>Referencing Blobs: Blobs are referenced by other objects in the system, such as tree objects (which represent directories) and commit objects (which represent commits). The commit object stores references to tree objects, which in turn reference blobs.</p> <p>Storing and Retrieving Blobs Storing: The hash_object command is responsible for creating a blob from a file. This command hashes the file\u2019s content and stores it in the .git/objects/ directory using the generated hash as the filename (with the first two characters as the directory name and the remaining characters as the filename).</p> <p>Retrieving: When a file is checked out or displayed using commands like cat_file, the system retrieves the corresponding blob from the object database using the hash.</p>"},{"location":"objects/commits/","title":"Commits","text":"<p>Commits A commit is a fundamental concept in version control systems, such as Git. It represents a snapshot of the entire repository at a specific point in time. Each commit contains references to one or more tree objects (which represent directories), blobs (which represent file contents), and a commit message describing the changes made in that commit.</p> <p>In a Git-like version control system, commits are used to track the history of the project, allowing users to revert to previous versions, view changes, and collaborate effectively.</p> <p>What is a Commit? A commit is a data object that represents a saved state of the version control system. Each commit has the following components:</p> <p>Commit Hash: A unique identifier for the commit, typically a SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash of the commit contents (which includes references to tree objects, commit message, and parent commits). Parent Commit(s): A commit can have one or more parent commits. The parent commit(s) represent the commit(s) from which this commit directly evolves. Tree Object: A commit points to a tree object that describes the file structure (directories and files) at the time of the commit. Commit Message: A message provided by the user when creating the commit that describes the changes made in the commit. Author Information: Information about the author (name, email, and timestamp) of the commit. Timestamp: The date and time when the commit was created. Commit Structure The commit object is usually represented in the following structure:</p> <p>php Copy code commit  tree  parent  (if any) author   committer   commit : This is the unique identifier of the commit (hash). tree : The commit points to a tree object that represents the file structure. parent : The commit's parent(s), if any. For the first commit, this field is absent. author and committer: These fields contain the name, email, and timestamp of the person who created the commit and the person who committed it (in some systems, these are the same). commit_message: A human-readable description of the changes made in the commit. How a Commit Works Creating a Commit: A commit is created after changes to files have been staged. This process involves creating a tree object that represents the file structure and associating it with one or more blobs (file contents). A commit object is then created, which references the tree object and contains metadata like the commit message, author, and timestamp. <p>Commit Hash: The commit hash is computed based on the commit content (i.e., the tree object hash, parent commit(s), author information, and commit message). This ensures that each commit is unique and immutable.</p> <p>Parent Commits: A commit can reference one or more parent commits. In a linear history, each commit has a single parent commit, while in a merge commit, multiple parent commits exist. This allows the system to track the sequence of changes over time.</p> <p>Commit Message: The commit message is crucial for understanding the purpose of a commit. A good commit message should briefly describe what changes have been made and why.</p>"},{"location":"objects/object_structure/","title":"Object structure","text":"<p>Object Structure In a version control system like Git, objects are the fundamental units of data that store various parts of the repository. These objects represent files, directories, commits, and other data structures. Each object is uniquely identified by its hash and is stored in the object database of the version control system.</p> <p>In this Git-like version control system, objects are divided into four main types:</p> <p>Blobs: Represent file contents. Trees: Represent directory structures. Commits: Represent changes to the repository at a particular point in time. Tags: Used for labeling commits (optional in basic systems). Each object is stored as a compressed file in the .git/objects/ directory and is accessed using its hash. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data, making the system fast and reliable.</p> <p>Types of Objects 1. Blob Objects A blob object stores the raw content of a file. It contains only the file's data and does not store any metadata (such as filename or modification time).</p> <p>Content: The raw data of a file (text or binary). Hash: The unique identifier for a blob, typically calculated using a hash function like SHA-1 or SHA-256. Example: Blob Object A file hello.txt with content Hello, world! will be represented by a blob object, and its hash is calculated from the content:</p> <p>sql Copy code blob 9fceb02b3f9b8d3420f2634ef8d0db4bdb8d73c9 2. Tree Objects A tree object represents a directory in the version control system. It contains references to blobs (representing files) and other tree objects (representing subdirectories). A tree object stores the hierarchy of files and directories at a particular point in time.</p> <p>Tree Structure: A tree object has a list of entries. Each entry corresponds to either a blob (for a file) or another tree (for a subdirectory). Hash: The unique identifier for a tree, calculated based on its contents (the entries it references). Example: Tree Object A directory with the following structure:</p> <p>scss Copy code / \u251c\u2500\u2500 hello.txt (Blob) \u2514\u2500\u2500 subdir/     \u2514\u2500\u2500 file_in_subdir.txt (Blob) This directory would be represented by a tree object that contains references to the hello.txt blob and another tree object for subdir. The tree object would look something like this:</p> <p>Copy code tree d8b2e68d8b084b35ff47e1e3b6e0dbab512f84d6 3. Commit Objects A commit object records a snapshot of the repository, including references to tree objects and other metadata, such as the commit message, author, committer, and parent commits.</p> <p>Parent Commit(s): A commit can have one or more parent commits. This allows the version control system to maintain a history of changes. Tree Object: The commit points to a tree object representing the state of the files and directories at the time of the commit. Commit Metadata: Includes the author\u2019s and committer\u2019s name, email, and timestamp. Commit Message: A description of the changes made in the commit. Example: Commit Object A commit object for the above directory structure might look like this:</p> <p>sql Copy code commit 8f4b21401b9a5b4165a9e8a5e2a6e759b64943bb tree d8b2e68d8b084b35ff47e1e3b6e0dbab512f84d6 parent a473cb5abf62b3c9a2e6990873dffbe6a8e74685 author John Doe john.doe@example.com 1632438527 +0200 committer Jane Doe jane.doe@example.com 1632438527 +0200 Initial commit In this example:</p> <p>The commit object points to a tree object (d8b2e68d8b084b35ff47e1e3b6e0dbab512f84d6). It also includes information about the parent commit, author, committer, timestamp, and commit message. 4. Tag Objects (Optional) Tag objects are used to mark specific commits in the history, often for releases. A tag object contains a reference to a commit object and additional metadata, such as the tag name and tagger information.</p> <p>Tag Name: A human-readable name (e.g., v1.0). Commit Reference: A tag references a commit in the repository. Tagger Information: The name and email of the person who created the tag. Tag Message: A message explaining the purpose of the tag. Example: Tag Object A tag object might look like this:</p> <p>css Copy code tag v1.0 object 8f4b21401b9a5b4165a9e8a5e2a6e759b64943bb tagger Jane Doe jane.doe@example.com 1632438527 +0200 Version 1.0 release Object Storage Objects are stored in the .git/objects/ directory in a specific structure:</p> <p>The object\u2019s hash is split into two parts: the first two characters are used as the directory name, and the remaining characters are the filename. For example, the object with hash 9fceb02b3f9b8d3420f2634ef8d0db4bdb8d73c9 would be stored in the following directory:</p> <p>bash Copy code .git/objects/9f/ceb02b3f9b8d3420f2634ef8d0db4bdb8d73c9 Each object is stored as a compressed file (using zlib compression) to save space.</p> <p>Object Lifecycle Creating Objects: Objects are created when files are added, changes are made, or commits are generated. Referencing Objects: Tree objects reference blob objects, commit objects reference tree objects, and tag objects reference commit objects. Immutable: Once created, objects cannot be changed. Any modification to an object (e.g., file content or commit message) results in the creation of a new object with a new hash. Garbage Collection: Over time, objects that are no longer referenced may be cleaned up to save space (this can be triggered manually or automatically in some systems). Object Integrity Each object is identified by its hash, which is calculated using its content. This provides a guarantee of data integrity:</p> <p>Hashing: The hash function (e.g., SHA-1 or SHA-256) ensures that even a small change in the content of an object results in a completely different hash. Immutability: Objects are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed once created. Any changes to files or commits result in new objects with new hashes.</p>"},{"location":"objects/trees/","title":"Trees","text":"<p>Tree Objects In a version control system like Git, tree objects represent directories. They are responsible for organizing files and subdirectories (other tree objects) in a hierarchical structure. A tree object is a container for references to blob objects (representing files) and other tree objects (representing subdirectories).</p> <p>Overview of Tree Objects Purpose: Tree objects are used to represent the state of a directory at a particular point in time. They maintain references to both files (in the form of blobs) and subdirectories (in the form of other trees). Contents: A tree object contains: Entries: A list of file and subdirectory references. Mode: A file type and permissions representation. Hash: The hash of the object that uniquely identifies the tree. Structure: The structure of a tree object mirrors the filesystem hierarchy. It represents a snapshot of a directory, where each entry is either a file (blob) or a subdirectory (tree). Tree Object Format A tree object has a simple structure. It contains the following fields for each entry:</p> <p>Mode: A 4-byte field that defines the file type and permissions (e.g., 100644 for a regular file, 040000 for a directory). Filename: The name of the file or subdirectory. Hash: The hash of the corresponding blob (for files) or tree (for subdirectories). Each entry in the tree object points to either a blob object (for regular files) or another tree object (for directories).</p> <p>Example of a Tree Object Let's consider the following directory structure:</p> <p>scss Copy code / \u251c\u2500\u2500 hello.txt (Blob) \u2514\u2500\u2500 subdir/     \u2514\u2500\u2500 file_in_subdir.txt (Blob) In this structure:</p> <p>hello.txt is a regular file, represented as a blob object. subdir/ is a directory, represented as a tree object. file_in_subdir.txt is a regular file inside subdir/, represented as another blob object. The tree object for this directory would look something like:</p> <p>Copy code tree 3f3a5a17f5e3a698cb674d5a924d2411f7809cf6 100644 hello.txt 9fceb02b3f9b8d3420f2634ef8d0db4bdb8d73c9 040000 subdir 39b593089317c268b7f9a04ca14ec94c1a5197b1 In this example:</p> <p>The tree object has two entries: The first entry refers to the hello.txt file (mode 100644). The second entry refers to the subdir/ directory (mode 040000). The hash for hello.txt is 9fceb02b3f9b8d3420f2634ef8d0db4bdb8d73c9, which points to the corresponding blob object. The hash for subdir/ is 39b593089317c268b7f9a04ca14ec94c1a5197b1, which points to the corresponding tree object for subdir. Creating a Tree Object When you create a directory or modify its contents, a tree object is created to represent the directory structure. The process is as follows:</p> <p>Adding Files: When a file is added to the directory, a corresponding blob object is created. The file\u2019s contents are hashed and stored as a blob. Adding Subdirectories: When a subdirectory is created, a new tree object is created to represent the subdirectory. Building the Tree: The tree object is built by combining the hashes of the blobs and trees that represent the files and subdirectories in the directory. This tree object points to these objects, forming a hierarchy of trees and blobs. Hashing: The hash of the tree object is generated based on its content (the mode, filename, and hash of the objects it references). This ensures the uniqueness and immutability of the tree. Storing Tree Objects Tree objects are stored in the .git/objects/ directory with a filename based on their hash. The structure for storing tree objects is the same as for blob objects:</p> <p>The first two characters of the hash represent the directory. The remaining characters form the filename. For example, the tree object with hash 3f3a5a17f5e3a698cb674d5a924d2411f7809cf6 would be stored at:</p> <p>bash Copy code .git/objects/3f/3a5a5f17f5e3a698cb674d5a924d2411f7809cf6 Tree Object Mode Codes Tree objects use mode codes to distinguish between different types of files and directories:</p> <p>100644: A regular file. 100755: An executable file. 040000: A directory. 120000: A symbolic link. 160000: A gitlink (used for submodules). Example Directory Tree and Tree Object Consider this simple directory tree:</p> <p>css Copy code / \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.go \u2514\u2500\u2500 docs/     \u2514\u2500\u2500 install.md The corresponding tree object might look like:</p> <p>css Copy code tree 4a0f5c7ab0bc8f1ad12fb1de8ac839241db1db09 100644 README.md 1d9c7b2e5f5e10f49083edcc91f46f98a04bc295 040000 src 8d824e4c7b2db44035da6329b7a597d08884b171 040000 docs 68a4c2099b1d91e401b53f9172de0212ae199d43 The tree object 4a0f5c7ab0bc8f1ad12fb1de8ac839241db1db09 represents the root directory. It has three entries: README.md (a regular file, mode 100644). src (a directory, mode 040000). docs (a directory, mode 040000). Each directory (src and docs) will have its own tree object that lists files in them. Summary Tree objects represent directories and contain references to files (blobs) and subdirectories (trees). They are organized in a hierarchical structure, mirroring the file system. Each entry in a tree object contains a mode, filename, and hash pointing to either a blob or another tree. Tree objects allow for efficient organization of files and directories in the version control system. The tree object\u2019s hash is unique and ensures integrity of the directory structure. Example Usage in the Git-like System In your Go-based Git-like version control system, when a user adds files or directories to the repository, tree objects are created to represent the structure. These tree objects are then used to generate commit objects that represent snapshots of the repository at particular points in time.</p>"}]}
