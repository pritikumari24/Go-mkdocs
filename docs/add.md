Add Function
The add function is responsible for staging files in a Git-like version control system. It allows users to add changes to the staging area, which are then ready to be committed. In Git terminology, this is similar to adding files to the index. The function computes the hash of the file contents, stores them in an object database (typically as "blobs"), and updates the index to track the files.

Purpose of add
The main goal of the add function is to:

Stage changes made to files by adding them to the version control system's index (staging area).
Compute a unique hash for the file content.
Store the file content as a "blob" object in the object database, allowing for efficient tracking of file content changes.
Update the index file to reflect the changes made to the staging area.
How It Works
File Input: The add function takes the path to a file as input. The user specifies which files to add to the staging area (for example, using a command like git add <file>).

Reading the File Content: The content of the specified file is read into memory. This can be done using standard Go file I/O operations (e.g., ioutil.ReadFile).

Hashing the File: The content of the file is hashed using a hashing function (typically SHA-1 or SHA-256) to create a unique identifier for the file. This hash is what will be used to store the file in the object database.

Creating the Blob Object: Once the file content is hashed, a "blob" object is created. This blob object contains the file's content and its unique hash.

Storing the Blob Object: The blob object is stored in an object database (a directory in your project, typically located under .git/objects), where each object is stored as a file with the hash value as its filename.

Updating the Index: The index (or staging area) is updated to reflect the added file. This is usually done by creating or modifying an index file that tracks which files have been staged. The index stores the file path and its corresponding object hash.

Function Signature
go
Copy code
func add(filePath string) error {
    // Implementation here
}
Parameters
filePath (string): The path to the file that needs to be staged. This is the file the user wants to add to the staging area.
Returns
error: Returns an error if the operation fails (e.g., if the file cannot be read, or if there is an issue with hashing the content). Otherwise, it returns nil to indicate that the file has been successfully staged.
Steps in the Implementation
Check if the File Exists: The function first checks whether the file exists at the given path. If not, it returns an error indicating that the file could not be found.

Read the File: If the file exists, the function reads its content into a byte slice. This is done using Goâ€™s standard file reading libraries.

Compute the Hash: After reading the file content, the function computes the SHA-1 hash of the file's content. This hash uniquely identifies the file content.

Create and Store the Blob: Once the hash is computed, a blob object is created and stored in the object database. The file content is stored as a new object file with the hash as its filename.

Update the Index: Finally, the function updates the index file to include the new file and its corresponding object hash. This allows Git to track the staged file for future commits.
