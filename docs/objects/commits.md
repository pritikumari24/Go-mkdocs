Commits
A commit is a fundamental concept in version control systems, such as Git. It represents a snapshot of the entire repository at a specific point in time. Each commit contains references to one or more tree objects (which represent directories), blobs (which represent file contents), and a commit message describing the changes made in that commit.

In a Git-like version control system, commits are used to track the history of the project, allowing users to revert to previous versions, view changes, and collaborate effectively.

What is a Commit?
A commit is a data object that represents a saved state of the version control system. Each commit has the following components:

Commit Hash: A unique identifier for the commit, typically a SHA-1 or SHA-256 hash of the commit contents (which includes references to tree objects, commit message, and parent commits).
Parent Commit(s): A commit can have one or more parent commits. The parent commit(s) represent the commit(s) from which this commit directly evolves.
Tree Object: A commit points to a tree object that describes the file structure (directories and files) at the time of the commit.
Commit Message: A message provided by the user when creating the commit that describes the changes made in the commit.
Author Information: Information about the author (name, email, and timestamp) of the commit.
Timestamp: The date and time when the commit was created.
Commit Structure
The commit object is usually represented in the following structure:

Copy code
commit <commit_hash>
tree <tree_hash>
parent <parent_commit_hash> (if any)
author <author_name> <author_email> <timestamp>
committer <committer_name> <committer_email> <timestamp>
<commit_message>
commit <commit_hash>: This is the unique identifier of the commit (hash).
tree <tree_hash>: The commit points to a tree object that represents the file structure.
parent <parent_commit_hash>: The commit's parent(s), if any. For the first commit, this field is absent.
author and committer: These fields contain the name, email, and timestamp of the person who created the commit and the person who committed it (in some systems, these are the same).
commit_message: A human-readable description of the changes made in the commit.
How a Commit Works
Creating a Commit: A commit is created after changes to files have been staged. This process involves creating a tree object that represents the file structure and associating it with one or more blobs (file contents). A commit object is then created, which references the tree object and contains metadata like the commit message, author, and timestamp.

Commit Hash: The commit hash is computed based on the commit content (i.e., the tree object hash, parent commit(s), author information, and commit message). This ensures that each commit is unique and immutable.

Parent Commits: A commit can reference one or more parent commits. In a linear history, each commit has a single parent commit, while in a merge commit, multiple parent commits exist. This allows the system to track the sequence of changes over time.

Commit Message: The commit message is crucial for understanding the purpose of a commit. A good commit message should briefly describe what changes have been made and why.
