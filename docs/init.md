init Function
The init function is responsible for initializing a new Git-like repository. It sets up the necessary directory structure, configuration files, and initializes the object database that will store all the objects (such as commits, trees, and blobs) for the repository. This is the first step in creating a new repository.

Purpose of init
The main goal of the init function is to:

Create the basic directory structure for the repository.
Initialize the object database where Git stores all objects (blobs, trees, commits).
Set up initial configuration files that allow the system to track the repository state and configuration settings.
Provide the foundation for further Git operations such as commits, branches, and object hashing.
How It Works
Create Repository Structure: The function creates the basic directory structure required for a Git repository:

.git/: The main directory for all Git data.
.git/objects/: Where all objects (blobs, trees, commits) will be stored.
.git/refs/: Stores references to branches and tags.
.git/HEAD: Points to the current branch reference (e.g., refs/heads/main).
.git/config: A configuration file for the repository.
Initialize Object Database: The object database is the heart of the version control system, where all the objects are stored. The init function ensures that the .git/objects/ directory is created.

Create Configuration Files: The function creates the .git/config file, which contains default configuration settings for the repository. This file typically includes settings such as the repository name, remotes, and user information.

Create Initial Branch: An initial branch (usually main or master) is created in the .git/refs/heads/ directory. This branch will point to the first commit made in the repository.

Create HEAD File: The HEAD file is created to point to the default branch (e.g., refs/heads/main), which will be the active branch for the repository.

Function Signature

func initRepo() error
Parameters
The initRepo function does not take any parameters. It works on the current directory and initializes the repository in the current working directory.

Returns
error: Returns an error if the initialization process fails. This could happen if the directory structure cannot be created, or if there are issues with file permissions. If the operation is successful, it returns nil.
Steps in the Implementation
Check if Already Initialized: The function first checks if the .git directory already exists in the current working directory. If it does, an error is returned indicating that the repository has already been initialized.

Create the .git Directory: If the .git directory does not exist, it creates the necessary subdirectories:

.git/objects/
.git/refs/heads/
.git/config
.git/HEAD
Set Up Default Branch: The function creates the initial branch (main or master), which will serve as the first branch in the repository. It creates a reference file under .git/refs/heads/ pointing to this branch.

Write the HEAD File: The HEAD file is created to point to the default branch (e.g., refs/heads/main). This file indicates the current branch the repository is on.

Create Default Configuration File: The function creates the .git/config file, which can later be updated with user-specific settings (e.g., user name and email).
