cat_file Function
The cat_file function is responsible for displaying the contents of a Git object, given its hash. In a Git-like version control system, files and other data are stored as objects in the object database, identified by their hashes. The cat_file function allows users to retrieve and view the content of these objects. This is similar to the git cat-file command in Git, which shows the content of a specific object.

Purpose of cat_file
The main goal of the cat_file function is to:

Retrieve and display the content of an object (such as a blob, tree, or commit) from the object database.
Provide a way to view the raw content of a Git object using its hash.
This function is useful for inspecting stored objects and for debugging purposes when working with a Git-like version control system.

How It Works
Object Hash: The cat_file function takes the hash of a Git object (e.g., a commit, tree, or blob) as input. The user provides the hash of the object they want to view.

Retrieve Object: The function looks for the object in the object database (typically a .git/objects directory or equivalent).

Object Type Detection: The function retrieves the object, and based on its type (whether it’s a blob, tree, or commit), it interprets the content appropriately.

Display Object Content: Once the object is retrieved, the function decodes its content and displays it to the user. The content could be raw file data (in the case of blobs), directory structure (in the case of trees), or commit information (in the case of commits).

Function Signature
go
Copy code
func catFile(hash string) error {
    // Implementation here
}
Parameters
hash (string): The hash of the object whose content needs to be retrieved and displayed.
Returns
error: Returns an error if the object cannot be found, if there is an issue reading the object, or if the object type cannot be interpreted. If the operation succeeds, it returns nil.
Steps in the Implementation
Check if the Object Exists: The function first checks if an object with the specified hash exists in the object database. If the object does not exist, an error is returned.

Read the Object Content: If the object is found, the function reads its content from the object database. This could involve reading from a file system or a database.

Identify the Object Type: The object is then inspected to determine its type. Git objects can be blobs (file content), trees (directory structure), or commits (snapshot of the repository). The type can often be determined by reading the object’s header or analyzing its structure.

Display the Object’s Content:

If it’s a blob, the raw file content is displayed.
If it’s a tree, the directory structure is displayed, showing the files and subdirectories.
If it’s a commit, the commit metadata (such as author, timestamp, commit message, and parent commit) is displayed.
Handle Errors: If any issues are encountered while reading or interpreting the object, the function returns an appropriate error message.
