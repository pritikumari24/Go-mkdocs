checkout Function
The checkout function is responsible for switching between different branches or commit histories in a Git-like version control system. It allows users to move to a different commit or branch, updating their working directory with the content of that commit or branch. The checkout function also handles switching between branches and restoring files from previous commits.

Purpose of checkout
The main goal of the checkout function is to:

Switch between commits, branches, or tags in the repository.
Update the working directory to reflect the state of a particular commit, branch, or tag.
Restore files to the state they were in at a previous commit or branch.
Handle scenarios like creating a new branch or restoring a file from a previous state.
How It Works
Commit or Branch Selection: The checkout function takes a commit hash or branch name as input. The user provides the commit or branch to which they want to switch.

Branch Handling: If a branch name is provided, the function determines the commit hash of that branch and performs the checkout by moving to that commit. If the commit hash is given directly, the function will check out that commit.

Update Working Directory: After determining the commit to check out, the function updates the working directory by replacing the current files with those from the checked-out commit. This includes adding, removing, or modifying files as necessary.

File Restoration: If the checkout is for a specific file, only that file will be updated to its state in the specified commit or branch.

New Branch Creation: If the user wants to create a new branch from the current state, the function can handle this by creating a new branch reference pointing to the current commit.

Function Signature
go
Copy code
func checkout(identifier string, createNewBranch bool) error {
    // Implementation here
}
Parameters
identifier (string): The commit hash or branch name to check out. This specifies which commit or branch the user wants to switch to.
createNewBranch (bool): A flag indicating whether the user wants to create a new branch from the current commit. If true, a new branch will be created at the current commit’s location.
Returns
error: Returns an error if the checkout operation fails. This could happen if the specified commit or branch doesn’t exist or if there is an issue updating the working directory. If the operation is successful, it returns nil.
Steps in the Implementation
Resolve the Identifier: The function first checks whether the provided identifier is a branch name or a commit hash. If it's a branch name, the function resolves it to the corresponding commit hash. If it's a commit hash, it is used directly.

Check if the Commit Exists: The function checks whether the commit or branch exists. If not, it returns an error.

Update the Working Directory: Once the commit or branch is resolved, the function updates the working directory by checking out the files from that commit. This involves:

Removing files that no longer exist in the new commit.
Adding files that are present in the commit but not in the working directory.
Modifying files to reflect their state in the commit.
Create a New Branch (if applicable): If the user has requested a new branch, the function creates the branch by adding a new reference to the branch pointing to the checked-out commit.

Handle Errors: If any errors occur during the checkout process, such as missing files or an invalid commit, the function returns an appropriate error message.
