commit Function
The commit function is responsible for creating a new commit in the repository. A commit represents a snapshot of the repository’s current state, including all files in the working directory that have been staged for commit. This function creates a commit object, stores it in the object database, and updates the current branch’s reference to point to the new commit.

Purpose of commit
The main goal of the commit function is to:

Capture the current state of the working directory by creating a commit.
Store changes in the repository’s history, making it possible to refer back to the state of the project at a specific point in time.
Update the current branch to point to the newly created commit, thereby advancing the branch history.
How It Works
Staging Area: Before committing, files must be staged. This typically involves adding modified or new files to an index or staging area, marking them for inclusion in the commit.

Commit Metadata: When committing, the function collects metadata such as the author (user), commit message, timestamp, and the parent commit (the previous commit on the branch).

Create Commit Object: The commit function creates a new commit object, which includes the following:

The hash of the tree object (representing the current file state).
The hash of the parent commit.
The commit message.
The author’s information.
Store Commit Object: The function generates a hash for the commit and stores it in the object database.

Update Branch Reference: After the commit is created, the current branch’s reference (a pointer to the commit) is updated to point to the new commit, effectively advancing the branch history.

Function Signature
go
Copy code
func commit(message, author string) error {
    // Implementation here
}
Parameters
message (string): The commit message describing the changes made in this commit.
author (string): The name and email of the author, typically formatted as "Name <email>".
Returns
error: Returns an error if the commit operation fails. This could happen if there are no changes to commit, if the staging area is empty, or if there is an issue with writing the commit object. If the operation is successful, it returns nil.
Steps in the Implementation
Check if There Are Staged Changes: The function checks whether there are any files staged for commit. If there are no staged files, it returns an error indicating that there’s nothing to commit.

Create Tree Object: A tree object is created to represent the current state of the files in the staging area. The tree object contains a list of all files and directories, along with their corresponding object hashes.

Generate Commit Object: A commit object is created that includes:

The hash of the tree object created in the previous step.
The hash of the current branch’s parent commit.
The commit message and author information.
Store the Commit Object: The commit object is stored in the object database, and its hash is calculated.

Update the Branch Reference: The current branch’s reference is updated to point to the newly created commit, advancing the branch’s history.
