status Command
The status command displays the current state of the working directory and staging area, allowing users to see which files have been modified, staged, or are untracked in the Git-like version control system. It provides an overview of the repository's status, helping users manage their changes before committing them.

Purpose of status
The primary goal of the status command is to:

Provide users with a summary of the changes in their working directory.
Inform users about the files that are staged for the next commit, as well as the ones that are modified but not staged.
Show untracked files that are not yet part of the repository.
How It Works
Working Directory Check: The function checks the working directory for any changes that have been made to files since the last commit. These can include modifications to existing files, new untracked files, or deletions.

Staging Area Check: The function checks the staging area to see which files are ready to be committed. This includes files that have been added to the staging area using the add command.

Untracked Files: Any new files in the working directory that are not tracked by the version control system will be listed as untracked.

Modified and Staged Files: Files that have been modified and added to the staging area are shown as staged for the next commit.

Display Information: The status function displays the following:

Modified files not yet staged for commit.
Files that are staged and ready for commit.
Untracked files.

Parameters
This function does not take any parameters, as it simply checks the state of the repository and working directory.
Returns
error: Returns an error if there is an issue accessing the repository's status (e.g., if the .git/ directory is missing). If successful, it returns nil.
Steps in the Implementation
Check the Working Directory: The function checks for any modified files in the working directory. It compares the current state of the files to the last commit's tree object to determine if changes have been made.

Check the Staging Area: It retrieves the files that have been staged for the next commit from the index file (the staging area). These files are ready to be committed.

List Untracked Files: The function checks for any files in the working directory that are not yet being tracked by the version control system. These files are not part of any commit and are considered untracked.

Display the Status: The function outputs a summary of the repository's status, categorized into:

Changes not staged for commit: Files that have been modified but are not yet added to the staging area.
Changes to be committed: Files that are staged and ready to be committed.
Untracked files: Files that are not tracked by the version control system.
