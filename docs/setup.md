Project Setup
This document explains how to set up and run the Git-like version control system project locally on your machine. It includes the prerequisites, installation steps, and configuration instructions to get the project up and running.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Go: The Go programming language must be installed. You can download and install it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/.

Git: While the project implements a Git-like version control system, it’s still useful to have Git installed on your machine for version control. You can download Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

Text Editor/IDE: Use a text editor or IDE for Go development, such as VSCode or GoLand.

Terminal: A terminal or command line interface is necessary for running commands and building the project.

Installation Steps
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine. If you haven't created a repository yet, you can use the following commands to set it up:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-git-like-project.git
cd your-git-like-project
If you already have the repository cloned, you can pull the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
2. Install Dependencies
If the project uses any external libraries, they will be listed in the go.mod file. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
This command ensures that all the necessary dependencies are downloaded and available.

3. Build the Project
To build the project, run the following command in the root of the project directory:

bash
Copy code
go build
This will compile the Go code and create an executable file in the project directory.

4. Run the Project
Once the project is built successfully, you can run it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start the Git-like version control system. If the project includes specific commands (e.g., add, commit, log), you can use them as follows:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go add <file>
go run main.go commit -m "Your commit message"
go run main.go log
Configuration
The project may require some configuration files to function properly, such as:

.git/ directory: The project simulates the Git repository structure. The .git/ directory is where objects (commits, trees, blobs) and references are stored. If you are starting a new repository, the init command will create this structure for you.
config file: Some configurations like user name, email, or default branch name might be stored in a configuration file within .git/config. You can edit this file to customize settings.
1. Initialize a New Repository
To initialize a new repository, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go init
This will create the necessary .git/ directory and setup the repository.

2. Set User Information
The project may include a setup command to configure user details (name and email). Run the following commands to set the user information:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go config --user-name "Your Name"
go run main.go config --user-email "your-email@example.com"
These details will be used when committing changes to the repository.

File Structure Overview
Here’s an overview of the file structure of the project:

bash
Copy code
your-git-like-project/
├── .git/              # Git-like repository storage directory
│   ├── objects/       # Directory for commit, tree, and blob objects
│   ├── refs/          # Branch references (e.g., main, HEAD)
│   ├── config         # Repository configuration file
│   └── HEAD           # Points to the current branch reference
├── cmd/               # Command files (e.g., for commands like add, commit)
├── main.go            # Entry point of the project
├── go.mod             # Go module dependencies
└── README.md          # Project documentation
.git/ Directory: This directory contains the actual storage for your version control system. It holds the commit history, object database (blobs, trees, commits), and references to branches.
cmd/ Directory: This folder contains the Go files responsible for the commands like add, commit, log, etc.
main.go: The main entry point of the program that ties together all the commands and logic.
go.mod: The Go module file that defines the dependencies for the project.
Running Tests
If the project includes unit tests or integration tests, you can run them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
go test ./...
This will run all the tests in the project and show the results in the terminal.

Troubleshooting
Error: go: module has no go.mod file: This error indicates that the project is not initialized as a Go module. Run go mod init <module-name> to initialize the module.
Error: Cannot find package: If you see errors about missing packages, make sure to run go mod tidy to fetch all required dependencies.
